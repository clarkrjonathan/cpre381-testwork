#HW3 2 - b

#Recursive strategy -
#We want a function that can take in n as a parameter and get its value
#it will do this by returning F(n-1) + F(n-2)


#base case is F(1) OR F(0) which should return 1 and 0 respectively

#NOTE: At least this recursive approach is naive and poor performance because of many repeated calculations
